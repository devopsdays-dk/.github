If you want to get in touch with us – the organizers — then you can simply head over to [the public discussions](https://github.com/orgs/devopsdays-dk/discussions) in this devopsdays-dk organization and start a new discussion.

You are welcome to ask us anything, suggest speakers or topics that you would like the program commitee to consider. Share experiences from other DevOpsDays events you've attended – anything.
